# Data Import and Preparation

## Overview

This stage focuses on importing and preparing the dataset for your bakery sales forecasting project. Efficient and accurate data preparation is fundamental for successful forecasting models. The task involves importing the dataset into VS Code, cleaning it, and creating new variables relevant to forecasting sales.

## Guidelines

Focus on the following key tasks:

- **Importing Data**

- **Merging Data from different sources**

- **Cleaning Data**

- **Handling Missing Values**

- **Creating new Variables** (Develop and integrate new variables that could significantly influence sales predictions. This may include date-related features (like day of the week, holidays), weather conditions, or special events.)

- **Transforming data** (e.g., converting metric data to categorical data)

## Task

Create a script to conduct the data import and preparation process. Ensure each step is well-documented.
